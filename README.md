## AWS S3 Setup

1. Create an AWS S3 bucket to store media files (images, videos, etc.).

2. Obtain your AWS access key ID and secret access key.

3. Store these credentials in a `.env` file at the root directory of your project:

    ```
    AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your-access-key-id
    AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your-secret-access-key
    ```

4. In `settings.py`, configure the S3 bucket credentials:

    ```python
    AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID = env('AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID')
    AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY = env('AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY')
    AWS_STORAGE_BUCKET_NAME = 'your-bucket-name'
    AWS_S3_REGION_NAME = 'your-region-name'
    AWS_S3_CUSTOM_DOMAIN = f'{AWS_STORAGE_BUCKET_NAME}.s3.amazonaws.com'
    ```

## PostgreSQL Setup

1. Create a new PostgreSQL database.

2. Note down the database name, username, password, host and port.

3. In `settings.py`, update the `DATABASES` configuration:

    DATABASES = {
        'default': {
            'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.postgresql',
            'NAME': 'your-db-name',
            'USER': 'your-db-user',

            'PORT': 'your-db-port',
        }
    }
    ```
